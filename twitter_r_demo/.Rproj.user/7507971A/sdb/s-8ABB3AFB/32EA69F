Make sure to give the app read, write and direct message authority.\n#Take note of the following values from the Twitter app page: \"API key\", \"API secret\", \"Access token\", and \"Access token secret\".\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"devtools\", \"rjson\", \"bit64\", \"httr\",\"igraph\"))\n\n#Make sure to restart your R session at this point\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"geoffjentry/twitteR\")\nlibrary(twitteR)\n\n#The API key and API secret are from the Twitter app page above.
